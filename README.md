# Trees
## Data Structure - Trees
A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. The top node is called the root, and every node can have child nodes. A tree is essentially a collection of nodes with the following properties:

- Root Node: The topmost node in a tree.
- Edge: Connection between two nodes.
- Child Node: A node that descends from another node.
- Parent Node: A node with one or more child nodes.
- Leaf Node: A node with no children.
- Depth/Level: The distance from the root node to a particular node.
- Height: The number of edges on the longest path from the node to a leaf.
